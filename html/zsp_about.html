			<h3> Meet Ned </h3>
			<p> Hello - my name is Zacharij Martin-Ned. I am a 27 year old creative & business owner, originally born in Conroe, Texas.
				I’ve always taken a liking towards the creative side of life, taking classes such as art, choir, even courses like anthropology in my short 
				college years. Due to being a military child, I was forced to move throughout the majority of my younger years - developing a deeper perspective
				of these qualities of life I took enjoyment of. As I began to mature, I realized there was a void of many of these activities in Central Texas
				(Predominantly Killeen/Copperas Cove/Harker Heights area) I felt we were lacking in the arts, music, expression - the creative side of life. 
				Along with creating my own brand with artistry, I decided to take on the challenge of creating a platform for artists to promote, express, 
				and network with other fellow creatives to help uplift the positive within the community & provide a new avenue for potential advancement with 
				that creativity. We promote authors, music artists, dancers, businessmen, congressman, etc. The overall goal is to help uplift those around us who 
				sometimes need help being uplifted & provide a shining light to this area and the amazing talent that lies here.  </p>
